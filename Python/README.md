Contains useful functions to deal with atomic simulations, mostly based on the Atomic Simulation Environment, because there is no point redoing something properly done by someone more qualified.

Some change will be enacted, such as the fact that trajectories may be loaded as tensors, as it will likely be faster to use for some analysis function than list of structures containing positions as arrays.
